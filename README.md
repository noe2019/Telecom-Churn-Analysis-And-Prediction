## Introduction

In the competitive telecom industry, understanding and mitigating customer churn is crucial for sustaining growth and profitability. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn through comprehensive Power BI dashboards, enabling stakeholders to grasp the factors driving customer attrition. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, this project provides actionable insights and predictive models to improve customer retention strategies.

## Data Overview

The dataset, `Customer_Data.csv`, used in this project includes customer demographics, account information, services used, and churn status. Key features analyzed include:

- **Customer ID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **State**
- **Contract**
- **Payment Method**
- **Monthly Charge**
- **Total Charges**
- **Churn Status**

## Project Objectives

1. **Churn Analysis**: Visualize customer churn across various dimensions such as demographics, geography, and services used.
2. **Churn Prediction**: Build a machine learning model to predict potential churners.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Identify key factors contributing to churn and provide recommendations to reduce churn rates.

## ETL Process

### Step 1: Data Extraction and Loading

Data was extracted from the telecom company's database and loaded into SQL Server to ensure data integrity and effective management. Initial exploration was conducted to understand the distribution of key features and identify any missing values.

### Step 2: Data Transformation

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were addressed, and categorical variables were encoded.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features like `Churn Status`, `Monthly Charge Range`, and `Age Group` were created for enhanced analysis and prediction.

### Step 3: Data Modeling and Prediction

- **Random Forest Model**: A Random Forest Classifier was employed to predict customer churn based on the engineered features.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## SQL Queries

### 1. **Create Database and Import Data**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE TelecomChurn;

   USE TelecomChurn;

   CREATE TABLE CustomerData (
       CustomerID VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
       Gender VARCHAR(10),
       Age INT,
       State VARCHAR(50),
       Contract VARCHAR(20),
       PaymentMethod VARCHAR(50),
       MonthlyCharge DECIMAL(10, 2),
       TotalCharges DECIMAL(10, 2),
       Churn VARCHAR(10)
   );

   BULK INSERT CustomerData
   FROM 'path_to_your/Customer_Data.csv'
   WITH (
       FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
       ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
       FIRSTROW = 2
   );
   ```

### 2. **Data Exploration**
   - **Check for Missing Values**:
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         SUM(CASE WHEN Gender IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Gender_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN Age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Age_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN State IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS State_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN Contract IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Contract_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN PaymentMethod IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS PaymentMethod_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN MonthlyCharge IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS MonthlyCharge_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN TotalCharges IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TotalCharges_Null,
         SUM(CASE WHEN Churn IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Churn_Null
     FROM CustomerData;
     ```

   - **Analyze Customer Demographics**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers
     FROM CustomerData
     GROUP BY Gender;

     SELECT Age, COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers
     FROM CustomerData
     GROUP BY Age;
     ```

   - **Churn Rate by Payment Method**:
     ```sql
     SELECT PaymentMethod, 
            COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers, 
            SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ChurnCount,
            (SUM(CASE WHEN Churn = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS ChurnRate
     FROM CustomerData
     GROUP BY PaymentMethod;
     ```

## DAX Queries

### 1. **Total Customers**
   ```dax
   TotalCustomers = COUNT(CustomerData[CustomerID])
   ```

### 2. **Total Churn**
   ```dax
   TotalChurn = CALCULATE(COUNT(CustomerData[CustomerID]), CustomerData[Churn] = "Yes")
   ```

### 3. **Churn Rate**
   ```dax
   ChurnRate = [TotalChurn] / [TotalCustomers]
   ```

### 4. **Churn Rate by Gender**
   ```dax
   ChurnRateByGender = 
   CALCULATE(
       [ChurnRate],
       FILTER(CustomerData, CustomerData[Gender] = "Male")
   )
   ```

### 5. **Churn Rate by Contract Type**
   ```dax
   ChurnRateByContract = 
   SUMMARIZE(
       CustomerData,
       CustomerData[Contract],
       "TotalChurn", [TotalChurn],
       "ChurnRate", [ChurnRate]
   )
   ```

## Power BI Visualization

### Summary Dashboard

The summary dashboard provides an overview of the key metrics:
- **Total Customers**
- **Total Churn & Churn Rate**
- **New Joiners**
- **Churn Distribution by Gender, Age Group, Payment Method, and Contract Type**

### Churn Prediction Dashboard

- **Predicted Churners**: This dashboard highlights customers who are most likely to churn, segmented by demographics, contract type, and other features.
- **Customer Profile**: Detailed profiles of predicted churners are provided, including their churn reasons and payment methods.

## Predictive Analytics

### Random Forest Model in Python

To predict customer churn, a Random Forest Classifier was utilized:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('Customer_Data.csv')

# Preprocess data and encode categorical variables

# Split data
X = data.drop('Churn', axis=1)
y = data['Churn']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Insights and Recommendations

1. **High Churn Rate in Month-to-Month Contracts**: Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rate across all segments, reaching as high as 54.2%. To reduce this churn, consider offering discounts or benefits for committing to longer-term contracts.
   
2. **Geographical Disparities**: Churn rates vary significantly across states, with regions like Jammu and Kashmir exhibiting churn rates as high as 61.3%, indicating a need for localized strategies to improve retention in these areas.

3. **Payment Method Impact**: Customers using Mailed Checks as their payment method have a significantly higher churn rate (52.0%) compared to those using Credit Cards (19.8%). Streamlining digital payment options could help reduce churn in this group.

4. **Age and Tenure Influence**: The analysis shows that customers aged over 50 and with a tenure of fewer than 6 months have the highest churn rates. Targeted engagement campaigns for new customers, particularly those in this age group, could be beneficial.

5. **Service-Related Churn**: Churn is notably higher among customers using specific services like Cable.
